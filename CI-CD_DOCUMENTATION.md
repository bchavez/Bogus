# Bogus CI/CD documentation

The pipeline:

- contains the Build and Test processes of the project
- uploads the results of the Test process as a pipeline artifact 
- executes on push commit, when a PR is created or merged and can also be executed manually

2. Click on the latest "Bogus CI/CD Pipeline" run from the "Runs list"
