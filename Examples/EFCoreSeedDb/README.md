## EF Core Seed Database Example with Bogus

#### Requirements
* **.NET Core 3.1** or later
* **EF Core 3.1** or later 

#### Description

The `EFCoreSeedDb` example is based on the [**EF Core Tutorial**][1] with the [**HasData**][2] method using **Bogus**.

To run the example, perform the following commands *inside* this `EfCoreSeedDb` folder:

  * `dotnet restore`
  * `dotnet build`
  * `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate`
  * `dotnet ef database update`
  * `dotnet run`
  
After the `dotnet` commands are executed above, you should have a `blogging.db` SQLite DB file that you can open and inspect the sample data generated from Bogus. Additionally, the `dotnet run` command will print out the data generated by Bogus to the console read from the `blogging.db` SQLite DB file.

The basic approach is to pre-generate your Bogus data in-memory, in static properties, before sending sample data to EF Core.

* `FakeData` - Uses the `Faker<T>` approach.
* `FakeData2` - Uses the `Faker` facade approach.

Either approach above can be used; pick whichever fits your preference and coding style.
