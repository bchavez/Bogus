# Bogus CI/CD documentation

* after merging the PR, the first run of the main workflow will not complete successfully, because it requires specific setup explained in this documentation

## 1. Set up TestSpace

The TestSpace tool is used to display the unit test results, that are generated by the internal testing sequence of the Bogus project.

1. Go to https://www.testspace.com/

2. Click on the "Start for free" button

3. Click on the "Get started" button, under the "Open" plan box

4. Go to the bottom of the page, under "Pricing and setup" choose the "Free" option on the left and click on "Install it for free" button on the right
* the "Free" option is for personal accounts
* the "Open" option is for organization accounts

5. Click on the "Complete order and begin installation" button

6. Select which repositories to work with this TestSpace installation
* select "Only select repositories" for better overall control
* from the dropdown, select the repositories you would like to see on the TestSpace dashboard

7. Enter your password, if prompt

8. You are going to be re-directed to the TestSpace dashboard

9. At the top right corner, click on your account name and choose **Edit** from the dropdown menu

10. Copy the value from the input field under the **Access Token** label

11. Go to GitHub and enter your repo

12. In the **Settings** tab, go to **Secrets**, add a new secret with the name **TESTSPACE_TOKEN** and paste the value you copied in step 10

- the TestSpace token is optional for public repos, but we've made it part of the implementation, to give the owner of the repo additional security

13. Go back to your TestSpace dashboard

14. On the righthand side at the top, click on "+ New Project" button

15. Select the GitHub repo you would like to display and click "OK"

16. Click on the name of your project

17. As soon as a workflow is ran successfully for the connected GitHub project, you would be able to see the results listed here
* "space" refers to a GitHub repo branch (master, feature/new-feature etc.) and each branch is displayed as a separate entity

<br>

## 4. Run workflow manually

Once you've set up all the steps above correctly, you should be able to successfully complete a manual execution of the main workflow "Bogus CI/CD Pipeline".

  1. Go to GitHub project -> "Actions" tab

  2. From the "Workflows" list on the left, click on "Bogus CI/CD Pipeline"

  3. On the right, next to the "This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger" label, click on the "Run workflow" dropdown, make sure the **master** branch is selected in the "Use workflow from" dropdown and click the "Run workflow" button

![Actions_workflow_dispatch](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Actions_workflow_dispatch.png)

  4. Once the workflow run has completed successfully, move on to the next step of the documentation

<br>

## 5. Create a TestSpace badge

Create a TestSpace badge in your README.md to quickly reference your internal test results

**NOTE: this step is available only after the manually executed workflow run has completed successfully**

1. Go to https://www.testspace.com/

2. Click "Sign in" at the right corner

3. In the "Project Listing", find your project and click on the "master" space

4. Click on the badge, that is above the data table

5. Click "Embed link"

<br>

## 6. Set up Dependabot

Dependabot is a GitHub native security tool that goes through the dependencies in your project and creates alerts, and PRs with updates when a new and/or non-vulnerable version is found.

- for PRs with version updates, this pipeline comes pre-configured for all current dependency sources in your project, so at "Insights" tab -> "Dependency graph" -> "Dependabot", you should be able to see all tracked sources of dependencies, when they have been checked last and view a full log of the last check

![Dependabot_tab](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Dependabot_tab.png)

![Dependabot_log_page](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Dependabot_log_page.png)

### Set up security alerts and updates
##### - GitHub, through Dependabot, also natively offers a security check for vulnerable dependencies

1. Go to "Settings" tab of your repo

2. Go to "Security&Analysis" section

3. Click "Enable" for both "Dependabot alerts" and "Dependabot security updates"

- By enabling "Dependabot alerts", you would be notified for any vulnerable dependencies in your project. At "Security" tab -> "Dependabot alerts", you can manage all alerts. By clicking on an alert, you would be able to see a detailed explanation of the vulnerability and a viable solution.

![Dependabot_alerts_page](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Dependabot_alerts_page.png)

![Dependabot_alert_page](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Dependabot_alert_page.png)

- By enabling "Dependabot security updates", you authorize Dependabot to create PRs specifically for **security updates**

![Dependabot_PRs](/Docs/CI-CD_DOCUMENTATION/Dependabot_PRs.png)

### Set up Dependency graph
##### - The "Dependency graph" option should be enabled by default for all public repos, but in case it isn't:

1. Go to "Settings" tab of your repo

2. Go to "Security&Analysis" section

3. Click "Enable" for the "Dependency graph" option

- this option enables the "Insights" tab -> "Dependency graph" section -> "Dependencies" tab, in which all the dependencies for the project are listed, under the different manifests they are included in

## 7. How to create a release

The "Release sequence" encompasses creating a release in your GitHub repo, adding the necessary files to it and pushing a NuGet package to the NuGet website.

Files added are: 
- NuGet package
- Symbols NuGet package
- Compilation folder (zip)
- Internal test results (xml)
- Source code (zip)
- Source code (tar.gz)

Note: **not every commit to your master branch creates a release**

Follow these instructions for any commit (push or PR merge) to your master branch, you would like to create a release.

Whenever you would like to trigger the "Create release" sequence, you would need one of three keywords at the start of your commit title. Each of the three keywords corresponds to a number in your release version i.e. v1.2.3. The release versioning uses the ["Conventional Commits" specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

* "fix: ..." - this keyword corresponds to the last number v1.2.**3**, also known as PATCH;
* "feat: ..." - this keyword corresponds to the middle number v1.**2**.3, also known as MINOR;
* "perf: ..." - this keyword corresponds to the first number v**1**.2.3, also known as MAJOR. In addition, to trigger a MAJOR release, you would need to write "BREAKING CHANGE: ..." in the description of the commit, with an empty line above it to indicate it is in the <footer> portion of the description;

Note: when making a MAJOR release by committing through a terminal, use the multiple line syntax to add the commit title on one line and then adding an empty line, and then adding the "BREAKING CHANGE: " label
<br><br>
### EXAMPLES

Example(fix/PATCH): <br>
`
git commit -a -m "fix: this is a PATCH release triggering commit"
`
<br>
`
git push origin master
`
<br>
Result: v1.2.3 -> **v1.2.4**
<br>
<br>
<br>
Example(feat/MINOR): <br>
`
git commit -a -m "feat: this is a MINOR release triggering commit"
`
<br>
`
git push origin master
`
<br>
Result: v1.2.3 -> **v1.3.0**
<br>
<br>
<br>
Example(perf/MAJOR): <br>
``
git commit -a -m "perf: this is a MAJOR release triggering commit `
``
<br> 
&gt;&gt; <br> 
&gt;&gt; ` BREAKING CHANGE: this is the breaking change"
`
<br>
`
git push origin master
`
<br>
Result: v1.2.3 -> **v2.0.0**
<br>
<br>
Note: in the MAJOR release example, the PowerShell multiline syntax ` (backtick) is used. After writing a backtick, a press of the Enter key should open a new line.
